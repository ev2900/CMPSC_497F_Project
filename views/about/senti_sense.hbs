                              Chris and Vamshi are the founders of Senti Sense. The company is still a small startup but its beginnings are even smaller and humbler. The original idea behind Senti Sense came from a desire to somehow deliver value on the massive data lake which is twitter. With a background in machine learning, Chris came up with the idea of using sentiment analysis on streaming tweets and applying clustering algorithms to identify emerging patterns in emotions. Vamshi quickly came to realize that there was business potential behind such an idea in an analytics platform. Combining these two rough ideas Senti Sense was born. The original direction of the company changed a lot. It was turbulent times at first. Big Data comes with big confusions. There were a lot of different directions to go in. After exploring ideas such as brand management and custom relationship platforms, we ultimately settled on personal analytics as a minimal viable product. So two guys and an idea, a State College based startup backed by the Lion Launch Pad Accelerator and the New Lead Initiative, this is Senti Sense. This is personalized analytics direct messaged to you.

                    	We are working on our minimal viable product. We have a service in place at the moment which includes a well developed front end or website and a better developed back end. Our current abilities on our website only include sign up. On the back end or on the analysis side, we currently have the ability to pull and store all the tweets from an account's followers. Looking at the individual tweets, we have the ability to mine the tweet for sentiment. Rank each one on a scale of 1 - 10 or from positive to negative. Then looking at all of the tweets we have some very rough clustering working. We also have a semi-automated direct messaging service working which sends the users their analytics. As we are developing out the product, our short term goals include: adding login functionality on our website. Fully automating our direct messaging service and developing out our clustering algorithm more. From a user perspective we currently have three beta users signed up and are working on tailoring the content of what we direct message each user.

                               Senti Sense is an interesting company. What is the real value of the company? There are a few answers. The first is the ‘most on the horizon’ revenue model. Software as a service. The second is in the technologies we have developed. There is some very serious machine learning and analytics going on behind the scenes. These tools are of potential value. The last is in our data as a capital. Don't tell anyone but we are storing all the public tweets we can get. We are drinking from the fire hose and soon enough we will have terabytes of past tweets. These represent a unique form of capital. Models can be built from this data. So what is the future for the company? We believe the future is at the cutting edge of machine learning. Neural networks, better cluster and complicated classification models built from terabytes of past data. We want to be able to predict what your network will do. Our future will leverage all of our resources. We will use our technology to build on stored data to deliver a better software as a service experience and increase revenue models.
