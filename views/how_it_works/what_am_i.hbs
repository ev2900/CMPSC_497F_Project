		        		After signing up we message you biweekly, every Tuesday and Thursday. In our message we currently include three pieces of information. We give you the average sentiment of your network. We give you the topics influencing the positive emotions in your network and we give you the topics influencing the negative emotions in your network. Senti Sense makes it easy for you to keep your finger on the pulse of your network. Reading our biweekly message can help you avoid posting on topics that provoke negative feelings. Or can give you ideas on topics that evoke positive feelings. As a twitter user with many followers, you may find that Senti Sense is insurance policy. The world of social media is volatile. One wrong tweet can wreck an entire account. Maybe as a twitter user you have less followers. Or you may have a hundred friends or so. Senti Sense can be a strategic innovation which can help you increase your influence in your network while also expanding it. Either way, it is a free service so why not have deeper insight messaged to you twice a week? You can always unsubscribe and while these are the features we offer now, there will be more to come which will focus on predicting the behavior of your network instead of reacting to them.
